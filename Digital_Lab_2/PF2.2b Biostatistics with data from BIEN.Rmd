In a previous digital lab, we worked together through an assignment in an R notebook. It introduced us to BIEN and GBIF, both free and open-access tool for researching, managing or learning about nature.We focused quite a bit on the geographic data. Today we're going to move on to consider some of the trait data. 

Today, to review build on our previous session with BIEN, we will re-visit some of the work we did to be sure proper libraries and some data are loaded. (As you know, no need to re-install.)



```{r}
#install.packages("BIEN")
library("BIEN")
library(ape) #Package for working with phylogenies in R
library(maps) #Useful for making quick maps of occurrences
library(sp) # A package for spatial data
#vignette("BIEN")


```

Download the data for a focal genus
```{r}
Artocarpus_altilis<-BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Artocarpus altilis")
```
It looks like nothing happened, but you actually have created a dataframe called Artocarpus_altilis, full of character data and numeric data. Use the commands below. The first allows you to view the so called meta-data (data about the data, how many observations, for example). The second command looks at the first six entries in the data.
```{r}
str(Artocarpus_altilis)
head(Artocarpus_altilis)
tail(Artocarpus_altilis)
```


As you know from looking at the browser, you can look up a rangemap. The command 
```{r}
breadfruit_rangemap<-BIEN_ranges_load_species("Artocarpus altilis")
```


```{r}
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg = "light blue", xlim=c(-180,20),ylim=c(-60,80))
plot(breadfruit_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
```

```{r}
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-180,-20), ylim=c(-60, 80))
plot(breadfruit_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
points(cbind(Artocarpus_altilis$longitude, Artocarpus_altilis$latitude), col="blue", pch=20, cex=1)
```


By default, RBIEN commands for species occurrence only downloads limited information, but those defaults can be changed to get more expansive data, including:
- species in cultivation are added to those occurring naturally
- occurrence data outside of the Americas
- more taxonomy data (authority, higher levels than genus and species)
- when occurrence happened; country of occurrence (etc)

```{r}
Artocarpus_altilis_full <- BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Artocarpus altilis",cultivated = T,only.new.world = F,all.taxonomy = T,native.status = T,observation.type = T,political.boundaries = T)

str(Artocarpus_altilis_full)

```


This was a slightly slower process because so much more data were obtained. 

Now let's map again, but on the world map instead of just the Americas. And let's show points from the full query in red, and overlay points from the default query (more limited) in red. 

```{r}
map('world',fill=T , col= "grey", bg="light blue") 

#Plot the points from the full query in red

points(cbind(Artocarpus_altilis_full$longitude,Artocarpus_altilis_full$latitude),col="red",pch=20,cex=1) 

# Plot the points from the default query in blue

points(cbind(Artocarpus_altilis$longitude,Artocarpus_altilis$latitude),col="blue",pch=20,cex=1) 
```

## TRAIT DATA AND LINKING THIS TO BIOSTATISTICS



```{r}
BIEN_trait_list()
```


```{r}
breadfruit_traits<-BIEN_trait_genus(genus = "Artocarpus")
str(breadfruit_traits)
breadfruit_traits
#breadfruit_traits
```


```{r}
Breadfruit_DBH <- BIEN_trait_traitbygenus(trait = "diameter at breast height (1.3 m)", genus = "Artocarpus")
str(Breadfruit_DBH)
Breadfruit_DBH

```

```{r}
names(Breadfruit_DBH)
```

```{r}
Breadfruit_DBH_small = Breadfruit_DBH[c(1:5)]
Breadfruit_DBH_small
Breadfruit_DBH_small = as.data.frame(Breadfruit_DBH_small)
class(Breadfruit_DBH_small)
head(Breadfruit_DBH_small)
class(Breadfruit_DBH_small$trait_value)
DBH = as.numeric(Breadfruit_DBH_small$trait_value)
class(DBH)

```


Note that a library is being loaded below, and without it the boxplots will not be generated. (This should be a package installed by default when R is installed or updated, but if it's not then you may needd to install it.)
```{r}
library(lattice)
head(Breadfruit_DBH_small)
boxplot(DBH~scrubbed_species_binomial, data=Breadfruit_DBH_small)

```
  	

```{r}
Breadfruit_WPH <- BIEN_trait_traitbygenus(trait = "whole plant height", genus = "Artocarpus")
str(Breadfruit_WPH)
Breadfruit_WPH

```

```{r}
names(Breadfruit_WPH)
```

```{r}
Breadfruit_WPH_small = Breadfruit_WPH[c(1:5)]
Breadfruit_WPH_small
Breadfruit_WPH_small = as.data.frame(Breadfruit_WPH_small)
class(Breadfruit_WPH_small)
head(Breadfruit_WPH_small)
class(Breadfruit_WPH_small$trait_value)
WPH = as.numeric(Breadfruit_WPH_small$trait_value)
class(WPH)

```



```{r}
# Population Mean Between Two Independent Samples
# http://www.r-tutor.com/elementary-statistics/inference-about-two-populations/population-mean-between-two-independent-samples
ttest_result1 = t.test(x=Breadfruit_WPH_small$scrubbed_species_binomial, y=Breadfruit_WPH_small$trait_value, paired=FALSE, alternative="two.sided")
ttest_result1
```

```{r}
library(lattice)
head(Breadfruit_WPH_small)
hist(WPH)
boxplot(WPH~scrubbed_species_binomial, data=Breadfruit_WPH_small)
```

```{r}
mean(DBH, data=Breadfruit_DBH_small)
mean(WPH, data=Breadfruit_WPH_small)
```



Below there is another package being installed into the library and then loaded from the library to be active in the R software. This allows summarizing within species (rather than the whole genus), generating standard functions such as means and standard deviations (sd). The on-line resource Quick-R can be helpful if you want a bit more support in generating summary statistics, especially within sub-groups. 

https://www.statmethods.net/stats/descriptives.html


```{r}
#install(doBy)
library(doBy)
summaryBy(DBH~scrubbed_species_binomial, data=Breadfruit_DBH_small, FUN=c(mean, sd))
summaryBy(WPH~scrubbed_species_binomial, data=Breadfruit_WPH_small, FUN=c(mean, sd))
```

```{r}
(unique(Breadfruit_DBH_small$scrubbed_species_binomial))
```



```{r}
(unique(Breadfruit_WPH_small$scrubbed_species_binomial))
```


## Exercises for completing the portfolio 
Do you think the difference in whole plant height is statistically significant between Artocarpus hirsutus and Artocarpus integer?

Can you combine what was learned in the previous lesson "Introduction to getting, testing and plotting data"? 

Can you choose the most appropriate of the following two tests, re-write and run the code, and create the last portion of this R Notebook to include output, and some interpretive comments about statistical support for or against that hypothesis? 



Also try this for a second species pair, which require obtaining some data from BIEN using R BIEN. 

Some possibilities might be 

cashews are from Anacardium occidentale and perhaps one of the wild cashews (see Wikipedia)

avocados are from Persea americana but there are other relatives in the genus Persea, notably P. coyo

chocolate and one (or a group) of its relatives within Theobroma

choose two species in the genus Agave (used for fiber, tequila; see Wikipedia)
