title: "Introducing R, R-Studio and R Notebook files"

Welcome to your first experience (in this class) with an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. 

R is a programming language designed for data analysis an statistics. It can be used for basic statistics and biostatistics such as 
1. calculate means and standard deviations for one or more variables in a data set
2. visualize data in many formats (bar graphs, box plots, pie charts, scatter plots, etc)
3. Devising and "fitting" statistical models from something as simple as a linear regression between a dependent variable (y) and an independent variable (x) to much fancier models that take into account geo-spatial or phylogenetic relationships


R has several big advantages:

1. It is open source, meaning that the people who develop it share it for free and are involved in developing it further based on user experiences

2. It is popular and democratic, partly because it is free and open source

3. It is (relatively) easy.

You may be skeptical of advantage #3, but R is one of the easier programming languages to learn and all of them are daunting at the beginning and easier over time. Moreover, learning one language wil lhelp you learn other languages. 


A main reason why R is considered "easy" is because most of the "computer science 
details" (representing numbers and objects at binary bits and bytes; memory management) are handled behind the scenes. This makes R a little slower than some languages, but that usually is not a big concern unless one is working with whole-planet or whole-genome data sets. We won't do that (yet)!

Trying out your R Notebook

R is An R Notebook is a way to write and run coWhen you execute code within an R notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Sometimes this is referred to as a "chunk" of code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Wasn't that fun? The reason that worked so well is that R studio has a "demo" dataset loaded. 

What we'll do next is use some additional code that is pre-written, and then you can try adding some variations on that code. 

In an R Notebook, you add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save an R notebook, you save two files. One is a file in an R-compatible format and the other is a file compatible with both R and a web browser (an HTML file). 

At the end of today's session (or when you're working later on a Portfolio assignment), you may want to re-name the file to re-save a version that includes added work, which will be of two types:
(1) new chunks that you've written and honed
(2) output that you produce when you're happy with your chunk of code and want to show the wonderful output that it generates.
