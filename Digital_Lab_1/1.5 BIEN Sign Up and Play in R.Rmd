This assignment will introduce you to BIEN, a free and open-access tool for researching, managing or learning about nature. It stands for Botanical Information and Ecology Network.  

Please visit http://bien.nceas.ucsb.edu/bien/ and read about it under "About BIEN" and then sign up for BIEN.
Most of the assignment can be done in a browser, except for the last few steps. Those can be done inside of R, and it's a good idea to get started with R early. If you need help with R, go look for the document "Starting with R for early assignments" and follow the directions. 

BROWSER-BASED WORK
1. Visit BIEN http://biendata.org
2. Look for "Login" at the upper right; register. It may be necessary for your e-mail to  receive a confirmation e-mail. If so, you'll need to go and retrieve it and validate your account.
3. Save yourself time and frustration later. If you haven't already done so, create a document for yourself now with all course-related usernames & password)
4. Click on BIEN in the lower right, which should bring you to the BIEN 3+ main page. 
5. You can try looking up any species using a Latin binomial typed into the search bar. Try sweetgrass, Hierochloe odorata. 
5. Impressive, right? Now explore your results in three ways: 
5a. Click on zoom in a few times. Return to your original view with zoom out, or clicking on E will toggle to a view of just the Americas.
5b. Click on layer control. Notice that you by default you can see a range map and dots for occurrences on one view. You can adjust that to make the range map less visible (highlighting occurrences) or to make the occurrences less visible (highlighting range). 
5c. Click on Download data. You can download trait data and occurrence data and peruse at your leisure. The occurrence data is much more voluminous, and if you look through it you will see that a lot of it is coming from herbaria, sometimes already aggregated through GBIF, another major repository for biodiversity informatics. 

R-STUDIO BASED WORK
6. Now, open R studio. You can open a version of this notebook in R Studio and follow instructions, or open a new "untitled" script in the script editor, and re-type and submit commands from there. The first thing to do is to install and load the package "BIEN" which allows you to access data records in BIEN and import them directly into R, where you can also map them (and there are tools for looking at them in phylogenetic context or to look at trait data, to be done in a Part 2.) 

```{r}
install.packages("BIEN")
### Then of course you need to open the package from your library of installed packages. Simultaneously, it's smart to open some other packages that may already be installed, which is done below with the library command 
```

```{r}
library("BIEN")
library(ape) #Package for working with phylogenies in R
library(maps) #Useful for making quick maps of occurrences
library(sp) # A package for spatial data
vignette("BIEN")


```

Download the data for our focal species
```{r}
Heirochloe_odorata<-BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Hierochloe odorata")
```
It looks like nothing happened, but you actually have created a dataframe called Heirochloe_odorata, full of character data and numeric data. Use the commands below. The first allows you to view the so called meta-data (data about the data). The second command looks at the first five entries in the data.
```{r}
str(Heirochloe_odorata)
head(Heirochloe_odorata)
```


As you know from looking at the browser, you can look up a rangemap. The command 
```{r}
breadfruit_rangemap<-BIEN_ranges_load_species("Artocarpus altilis")
```
Also download the occurrence data for our focal species
```{r}
Artocarpus_altilis<-BIEN_occurrence_species(species = "Artocarpus altilis")
```


```{r}
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg = "light blue", xlim=c(-180,20),ylim=c(-60,80))
plot(breadfruit_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
```

```{r}
map('world', fill=T, col="grey", bg="light blue", xlim=c(-180,-20), ylim=c(-60, 80))
plot(breadfruit_rangemap, col="green", add=T)
points(cbind(Artocarpus_altilis$longitude, Artocarpus_altilis$latitude), col="blue", pch=20, cex=1)
```
